## Logic Analysis

- ['app.py', 'Contains the main Flask application and routes for file upload, outline generation, and document preview.']
- ['templates/index.html', 'Contains the HTML structure for the web interface.']
- ['static/styles.css', 'Contains the CSS styles for the web interface.']
- ['utils/file_processor.py', 'Contains the FileProcessor class for processing the uploaded file.']
- ['utils/doc_generator.py', 'Contains the DocGenerator class for generating the document outline and the new Word document.']
- ['utils/ai_model.py', 'Contains the AIModel class for generating the document outline using the OpenAI GPT model.']

## Task list

- utils/file_processor.py
- utils/ai_model.py
- utils/doc_generator.py
- app.py
- templates/index.html
- static/styles.css

## Shared Knowledge


        'utils/file_processor.py' contains the FileProcessor class which has a method 'process_file' that takes a file path as input and returns the template text.
        'utils/ai_model.py' contains the AIModel class which has a method 'generate_outline' that takes the template text as input and returns the document outline.
        'utils/doc_generator.py' contains the DocGenerator class which has a method 'generate_doc' that takes the document outline and project information as input and returns the path of the generated document.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
