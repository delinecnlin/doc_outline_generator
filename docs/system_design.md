## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. To handle file uploads, we will use Flask's built-in file upload functionality. For processing Word and PDF files, we will use python-docx and PyPDF2 respectively. For generating the document outline, we will use Azure's OpenAI GPT model. We will use python-docx again to generate the new Word document. For the system design diagram, we will use matplotlib or seaborn to generate the diagram and then insert it into the Word document. For previewing the document, we will convert the Word document to HTML using python-docx and display it in the web browser.

## Data structures and interface definitions


    classDiagram
        class FileProcessor{
            +str file_path
            +str file_type
            +__init__(file_path: str)
            +process_file(): str
        }
        class DocGenerator{
            +str outline
            +dict project_info
            +__init__(outline: str, project_info: dict)
            +generate_doc(): str
        }
        class AIModel{
            +str template_text
            +__init__(template_text: str)
            +generate_outline(): str
        }
        FileProcessor "1" --> "1" AIModel: uses
        AIModel "1" --> "1" DocGenerator: uses
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant A as App
        participant F as FileProcessor
        participant M as AIModel
        participant D as DocGenerator
        U->>A: Upload file
        A->>F: process_file()
        F-->>A: Return template_text
        A->>M: generate_outline(template_text)
        M-->>A: Return outline
        U->>A: Input project_info
        A->>D: generate_doc(outline, project_info)
        D-->>A: Return doc_path
        U->>A: Preview doc
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
